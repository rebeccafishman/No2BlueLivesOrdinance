					<h5>Dear Alderman ___________,</h5>
					<p>My name is _____________________. I am a concerned about ordinance 4878, also referred to as the Blue Lives Matter bill. If passed, this ordinance would provide police the opportunity to punish people speaking out against police brutality. This is a violation of our freedom of speech. This ordinance is also problematic because enables police to terrorize and silence people in marginalized communities.</p>
					<p>People of Chicago want to know where do you stand on this ordinance? Are you in favor of it or are you opposed to this ordinance?</p>
