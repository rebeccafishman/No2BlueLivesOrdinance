<h2>FAQ</h2><br>


<h3>What is ChiCalls?</h3>
<h4>ChiCalls aims to increase Chicagoans' engagement with local politics by 
connecting you with your alderman and providing information about actions you can take regarding issues that you care about. Whether it’s in your ward or city-wide, there’s always something you can do to make a difference in the city! </h4>

<h3>How do I use ChiCalls?</h3>
<h4>On the front page, enter your address into the search bar. You will receive information about your ward and your Alderman. From there, you can select the issues that you care about and see relevant scripts and actions for your ward and the city. The rest is up to you!</h4>

<h3>What do aldermen do?</h3>
<h4>Aldermen make up Chicago’s City Council, which passes city-wide legislation. As City Council members, aldermen are responsible for representing their ward in discussions and voting on legislation. They also serve on city council committees, which work with the city government to address specific issues such as zoning issues, housing, finance, etc…  As the ward representative, they also serve as their constituents’ connection to city services and oversee the deployment of city resources in the ward.</h4>

<h3>Can I visit my alderman?</h3>
<h4>Yes, you can! An in person visit can be powerful because it gives you a chance to speak with your alderman face to face. Many aldermen have public events designed to engage with their constituents and every alderman has an office in their ward that you can visit. Remember, this is local politics, and you should take advantage of the fact that you live in the same ward as your representative! </h4>

<h3>Does calling aldermen really do anything?</h3>
<h4>Yes! Calling your alderman absolutely helps! Their offices have a small staff and your call can make a big difference. Aldermen are concerned with being reelected, so it is in their best interest to listen to their constituents. Calls are also heard immediately, as opposed to emails, letters, or faxes, so they are often the fastest way to communicate with your representative. Aldermen have local offices in their ward and City Hall offices. Don’t hesitate to call both offices, but try to direct more ward-specific issues to the ward office and city-wide issues to the City Hall office.</h4>

<h3>Should I leave a voicemail?</h3>
<h4>You should leave a voicemail. Be sure to state your name and full address so they know you are one of their constituents. They are tallied just like phone calls.</h4>

<h3>Can I only call my own aldermen?</h3>
<h4>Your alderman depends on your vote. Thus, they have a reason to listen to your voice. Calling other aldermen does not have this effect.</h4>

<h3>I call my senators. Why should I call my local politicians?</h3>
<h4>The majority of news media focuses on national politics, and it’s easy to forget how local politics have a direct impact on our lives.The city council votes on various measures like transportation policies, low-income housing decisions, and environmental initiatives, all of which can have a huge impact for you and all Chicagoans.</h4>

<h3>How is an action different than a phone call?</h3>
<h4>Actions are specific, directed, and planned events that are often organized by activist groups. Whereas a phone call is a way for you as an individual to speak your voice about a particular issue at any time you want, an action is a group effort that is coordinated usually by experienced people who know how to ensure their goals are met. Actions can be a way of amplifying many voices at once around one issue or a specific set of issues, and they can also be intentionally disruptive of public activities in order to do so. A phone call utilizes the intended, government-encouraged route of communication, which is important, but different than an action.</h4>

<h3>What if I appreciate the work my alderman is doing?</h3>
<h4>Call them and let them know! If you like your alderman, then this is a way to give your support. Your comments are another way to lend your voice and offer positive reinforcement for your alderman’s actions.</h4>

<h3>Do I need to make a separate call for each issue I care about?</h3>
<h4>When you call your Alderman, you can call about multiple issues. However, making a separate call for each issue and/or calling both the ward office and the city-hall office can have a bigger impact because call volume is noted.</h4>
