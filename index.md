Hello! Welcome to the ChiCalls breakout group.  We have created this document to go over some of the more basic aspects of this project to catch up people who are new, so you can jump right in!
 
To get a better understanding of what we are aiming to do with our site, please visit https://5calls.org or http://thebluestlie.com.
 
Functionality
The format of the site will be very similar to 5calls but with a focus on Chicago rather than state or national issues.  Website users will enter their address. They will receive their alderman’s contact info and a selection of issues that they can click on depending on what cause interests them. After selecting their issue, they will be provided with  ward-specific and city-wide calls to action and/or suggested scripts.  
Example: Calling your alderman about CPAC if you support police accountability. 
Example: Calling your alderman who’s on the zoning committee for the affordable housing project in Jefferson Park. 
Example: Calling the mayor about funding CPS.
